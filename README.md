# WebHooksMessageService

**This repository contains the files for a simple full-stack web application "WebHooksMessenger". It is a school assignment for the course Cloudservices**

This simple web application allows users to send messages directly to my Teams channel "WebHooksMessages". It is a full-stack Node.js Express application, and it hosts both static content(the user interface) and the backend.
Teams Webhooks were used to get messages through directly to my Teams channel.
